## Contactless angle sensing

{how does the magnetic encoder work and how is it different from a normal encoder????}

{will the switches u have on ur kb with the magnetic sensors get afffected by the magnet on the sw???}

Compared to traditional rotary encoders (found within most computer mice), magnetic Potentiometer offers a greater degree of precision, while also Exhibiting the traits of high durability

Traditional encoders work by scraping metal brushes onto a disk, or shining light through a marked disk, neither of which are as reliable. 

Physical contact within metal brushes may fail due to dust/liquid getting into the compartment, corrosion of metal, deformation of the brushes, all of which stop brushes from getting in contact with the plate, which may result in the encoder skipping steps, false activation, which may render it completely useless.

Although having a longer life time than their contact counterparts, Encoders that use light also has a limited lifespan and limited resolution. As they all use similar encoding disks, resolution depends on how small they make each increment, usually more than 10 degrees. Dirt and grime may enter the encoding disk, clogging up holes that the light shines through, and the light/laser diodes used will eventually fail or reduce in brightness. the entire assembly is costly to replace as there is a number of components involved.

However Magnetic Potentiometer solve most of the problems mentioned above. They work by measuring the magnetic field of a horizontally polled magnet using multiple hall effect sensors. this is an analog solution and in a theoretical world, would offer infinite resolution. The AS5600 used in revolute offers up to 1Â° accuracy, using 4 hall effect sensors, converting the analog input into digital in the form of I2c. The downsides of magnetic Potentiometers is that it could be susceptible to magnetic noise in the surrounding, this will unlikely impact daily use as the strength of magnet is inversely proportional to its distance, meaning that as the magnet gets closer, magnetic strength will increase in the order of magnitudes. no ordinary magnet at a decent distance would have a stronger magnetic field than the one placed directly on top of the sensor, and would have negligible impact on the sensors reading.
